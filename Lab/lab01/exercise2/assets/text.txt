Seasoned player or complete newbie?
All levels of players are welcome! However, your level of experience determines which team you will join for your first season:
Know the rules and played before? Great, let us know which competition, region and division you have previously played in and we will match you with a suitable team.
New to the sport? No worries! We run specialised training programs to get newcomers up to speed with the rules and skills of the game. We'll get you ready for your first season in a competitive environment.
