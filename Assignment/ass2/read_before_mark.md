Attention: I write all my code with myself without use the given API.js, so if you want to change the port number for test, please change the fourth line in the login.js, the default port number is 5000.

```
window.token = "";
window.loginName = "";
//change port number here:
window.portNumber = 5000;
```

The main idea of my ass2 program divide into below script:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="src/login.js" id="loginJs"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="src/signup.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="src/showfeed.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="src/button.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="src/changeProfile.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="src/profile.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="src/main.js"></script>
```

In the login.js and signup.js, it contain the basic function to check the invalid inout and send data to the server.

In the showfeed.js, it response to show the feed to the user in the main page.

In the button.js, it contain the trigger function for most of buttons, such as like, dislke, follow, unfollow, comment and so on.

In the profile.js and changeProfile.js, it response to show the profile for the current user and other users, also show the page to the the profile for the current users.

In the main.js, it response to show infinite content when scroll.

The follow functions was asked did not finished in my ass2:

##### 2.6.1. Push Notifications

##### 2.7.2Static feed offline access

##### 2.7.3 Fragment based URL routing
